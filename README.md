# Samagra Launcher ðŸš€  

**Samagra Launcher** is an open-source Android launcher that aims to combine the best features, styles, and functionalities of multiple famous launchers into a single, highly customizable experience.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission  
We are building a **flexible and powerful Android launcher** from the ground up. Our goal is to integrate the best features from different launchers into a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly experience.  

## ðŸ›  Current Status  
We are in the **early development phase**, focusing on:  
- **Project Structure** â€“ Defining architecture and core modules.  
- **Feature Planning** â€“ Designing individual components and functionalities.  

## ðŸš€ Development Roadmap  
- Until basic functionality (app drawer, home screen, basic settings) is developed, the **repository will remain private**.  
- Once the launcher reaches a **usable state**, we will **open the repository for public contributions**.  

## ðŸ’¡ How You Can Contribute  
At this stage, we are not accepting direct contributions, but you can:  
- **Create issues** to suggest features and improvements.  
- **Follow our progress** through updates and discussions.
